description: Play an RPG-Harness game from the shell. Use this skill when you're inside a folder containing game.yaml + characters/ + scripts/ (an RPG-Harness game), and the user wants you to play through the game — either as yourself or in character as a persona. Drives the game via the `rpgh` CLI, reading stdout JSON and writing stdin one input at a time.

# rpg-harness-player

You're a player playing through an RPG-Harness game. You make decisions, the game advances, you reach an ending. You write no code — you only invoke the `rpgh` CLI and react to its JSON output.

## Before you start

Check three things:

1. **The `rpgh` binary is available.** Run `which rpgh` or `bun run rpgh --help` from inside the RPG-Harness repo. If neither works, ask the user to install it (`brew install bun && bun link` inside `packages/cli/`).
2. **You're at the right path.** Identify the game directory. It contains `game.yaml`, `characters/`, `scripts/`. Use an absolute or repo-relative path going forward (the CLI doesn't care).
3. **Pick a session name.** A session is your save file. Pick something descriptive: `claude-thoughtful`, `playthrough-cautious`, `demo-2026-05-21`. Don't use someone else's session — that overwrites their save.

```bash
GAME="examples/sengoku-raid"      # adjust to actual game dir
SESSION="claude-$(date +%H%M%S)"  # or any unique name
```

## The loop (this is the whole skill)

```
[peek once] → read output → decide input → [step with input] → read output → repeat
```

### Step 1: See where you are

```bash
rpgh peek "$GAME" --session "$SESSION"
```

Output is a single line of JSON:

```json
{
  "output": { "type": "...", ... },
  "done": false,
  "state": { "baseline": { ... } }
}
```

If `done` is `true`, the game is over. Read the final state and tell the user which ending you reached.

### Step 2: Decide based on `output.type`

| output.type | Meaning | Your input |
|---|---|---|
| `scriptComplete` | Between scripts — engine waits for you to pick one of `nextAvailable[]` | `{"type":"select","scriptId":"<id>"}` |
| `narration` | Pure story text (no speaker) | `{"type":"next"}` |
| `dialogue` | A character speaks (`speakerName` + `text`) | `{"type":"next"}` |
| `choice` | Story branch — pick one of `options[]` (0-based index, only `available:true` ones) | `{"type":"choose","index":N}` |
| `clear` | Scene break, just advance | `{"type":"next"}` |
| `gameEnd` | You hit a terminal — no more scripts available | Stop. Report the ending. |

### Step 3: Apply your decision

```bash
rpgh step "$GAME" --session "$SESSION" --input '{"type":"choose","index":2}'
```

The output of `step` is the **next** event. You do NOT need to `peek` again — just react to what `step` printed.

### Step 4: Loop until done

Keep doing step 2 + step 3 until you see `gameEnd` or `done: true`.

## Reading like a player, not like a parser

Even when output is just narration or dialogue, **read the text**. The story is the point. Tell the human what's happening in your own words occasionally — don't just dump raw JSON or robotically advance.

When the output is a `choice`, before sending input:

1. State your interpretation of the situation in 1 sentence.
2. List the options and what each one signals.
3. Pick one and say why.

Example:

```
> 现在的场景：薄樱在樱花树下画画，问我也喜欢樱花吗。
> 选项：
>   1. 嗯，很美 — 安全
>   2. 只是路过 — 冷淡
>   3. 我喜欢看你画 — 主动
> 我选 3，因为这个 persona 是直接型，而且这个选项有 +2 affection
```

Then:

```bash
rpgh step "$GAME" --session "$SESSION" --input '{"type":"choose","index":2}'
```

## Choosing in character

If the user gave you a persona ("play as a cautious introvert" / "play as someone trying to reach the bea-good ending"), every choice should follow that persona. Don't break character to optimize.

If the user said "just play your way", reveal your taste in the choices. Don't fake.

## Locked options

In a `choice`, options have `available: true` or `available: false`. Locked options cannot be picked — picking them is a no-op (engine yields the same choice again). When you see a locked option, mention it in your reasoning ("the bold option requires affection >= 2, I don't have that yet").

## When the game ends

```bash
rpgh peek "$GAME" --session "$SESSION"
```

The final state's `baseline.completedScripts[-1]` is the ending you reached. Tell the user:
- Which ending
- A 1-sentence reflection
- (If they asked) how to read the log: `cat "$GAME/.rpg-harness/sessions/$SESSION/log.jsonl"`

## Fork your save

A session is a directory. To branch and try a different choice:

```bash
cp -r "$GAME/.rpg-harness/sessions/$SESSION" "$GAME/.rpg-harness/sessions/${SESSION}-fork"
# Continue with --session "${SESSION}-fork" from a previous state
```

You can't go "back" within a single session (engine is forward-only), but you can fork before a key decision and play both branches.

## Hard rules

- Never modify the game's `scripts/` or `characters/` files unless the user explicitly asks. The author wrote them.
- Never run `step` against a session you don't own (sessions list at `<game>/.rpg-harness/sessions/`).
- The only `rpgh` subcommands you should use for play: **peek, step**. (`sessions` is informational; `test` and `autoplay` are not for playing.)
- If something errors with "ENOENT" or similar, you're probably in the wrong directory or used a wrong path. Don't keep retrying — check `pwd` and `ls`.

## Example transcript

```bash
$ rpgh peek "$GAME" --session "$SESSION"
{"output":{"type":"dialogue","speakerName":"narrator","text":"慶長十年、初秋。"},"done":false,"state":{"baseline":{"currentScriptId":"000_intro",...}}}

# Intro is auto-launched (sengoku-raid sets currentScriptId in onSessionStart).
# Just drain it with `next`.
$ rpgh step "$GAME" --session "$SESSION" --input '{"type":"next"}'
{"output":{"type":"dialogue","speakerName":"narrator","text":"江戸城本丸の大広間。蝋燭の煙が天井に渦を巻く。"},...}

# ... drain ~12 beats of intro until the hub menu appears
$ rpgh step "$GAME" --session "$SESSION" --input '{"type":"next"}'
{"output":{"type":"hubMenu","snapshot":{"activities":[{"id":"depart:kuro_swamp","title":"出立 — 黒沼地（難度 1）",...}, ...]}}, ...}

# Depart on the easiest raid.
$ rpgh step "$GAME" --session "$SESSION" --input '{"type":"doActivity","id":"depart:kuro_swamp"}'
{"output":{"type":"narration","text":"黒沼地に踏み入る。霧が脛に絡みつく。"},...}

# ... eventually you'll see a choice (kagari first-meet) or end at an ending.
$ rpgh peek "$GAME" --session "$SESSION"
{"output":{"type":"gameEnd"},"done":true,...}

# Report:
> 通关。结局：ending_pure_rite — 公儀の道、鎮魂結界の儀。
```

That's it. The whole skill.
